# Bamboo JFrog Plugin

</div>

## Overview
Artifactory provides tight integration with Bamboo through the Bamboo JFrog Plug-in.
Beyond managing efficient deployment of your artifacts to Artifactory, the plug-in lets you capture information about artifacts deployed, dependencies resolved, environment data associated with the Bamboo build runs and more, that effectively facilitates fully traceable builds.
