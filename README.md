## Overview

The [Bamboo JFrog Plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1231543/jfrog-for-bamboo) is designed to provide an easy integration between Bamboo and
the [JFrog Platform](https://jfrog.com/solution-sheet/jfrog-platform/).

Unlike the legacy [Bamboo Artifactory Plugin](https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/27818), the new **Bamboo
JFrog
Plugin** focuses on a single task that runs [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/jfrog-cli) commands.
Worth mentioning that both JFrog plugins, can work side by side.

The advantage of this approach is that JFrog CLI is a powerful and versatile tool that integrates with all JFrog
capabilities.
It offers extensive features and functionalities, and it is constantly improved and updated with the latest enhancements
from JFrog.
This ensures that the Bamboo JFrog Plugin is always up-to-date with the newest features and improvements provided by
JFrog.

With the Bamboo JFrog Plugin, you can easily deploy artifacts, resolve dependencies, and link them to the build jobs
that created them. Additionally, you can scan your artifacts and builds for vulnerabilities
using [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) and distribute your software packages to remote locations
using [JFrog Distribution](https://jfrog.com/distribution/).

## Key Features

- **Artifact Management**: Manage build artifacts with Artifactory.
- **Dependency Resolution**: Resolve dependencies from Artifactory for reliable builds.
- **Build Traceability**: Link artifacts to their corresponding build jobs for better traceability.
- **Security Scanning**: Scan artifacts and builds with JFrog Xray for vulnerabilities.
- **Software Distribution**: Distribute software packages to remote locations using JFrog Distribution.

## JFrog CLI Settings

1. By default, latest JFrog CLI will be installed and used when the JFrog CLI task runs.
   You can specify a specific version to be used.

2. If your Bamboo agents have access to the internet, you can set the JFrog Plugin to download JFrog CLI directly
   from https://releases.jfrog.io.
   If not, you can set the plugin to download JFrog CLI through the configured Artifactory instance.
